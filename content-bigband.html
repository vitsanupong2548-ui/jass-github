The band was conceived to be a musical ambassador for the city of Chiang Mai. Its core mission is to provide a stage for the incredible local talent of our city and to spark inspiration in the next generation of musicians. It stands as a testament to the idea that by working together, we can achieve extraordinary projects and reach new creative heights.</p>
                <p id="dyn-bigband_p2" class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed lg:leading-[1.6]">As we look to the future, the Bigband plans to expand its repertoire, collaborating with both local artists and international jazz musicians. We believe that music is a universal language, and through our performances, we aim to connect the rich cultural heritage of Northern Thailand with the global jazz community.</p>
